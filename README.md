- 👋 Hi, I’m @kingShazor
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming. I want to diversify because I have only used one programming language for decades. I'm only good at solving certain tasks in our framework too quickly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NeoVim (I'm used to programming without anycompiler intelligence other than the one that marks every line as an error (eclipse) - watched 'C++ Coding with Neovim - Prateek Raman - CppCon 2022'), Python, some C++ fundamentals, which you don't learn in an big framework environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an 'low level' project.
- 📫 How to reach me: notifications
- 😄 Pronouns: Me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm going into thy gym for six years now (= with the right efford), but I don't look like that I lift.

P.S. Don't let you get fooled by scrum coaches. They are all liars! I will write a blog post (huge one), about the many lies and misconceptions of scrum.
